This app shows places where I encountered Australian Wildlife. By selecting one, more information drawn from Wikipedia and Flickr can be accessed. By activating a marker, purple paws indicate spots on the map, where other people on Flickr encountered the same animal.

How to run the app

1) Fork the repository
2) Open either index.html in the main directory or the index.html in the build folder for minified built code.
3) Have fun with the app!

Don't change the folder structure!
