This app shows places where I encountered Australian Wildlife. By selecting one, more information drawn from Wikipedia and Flickr can be accessed. By activating a marker, purple paws indicate spots on the map, where other people on Flickr encountered the same animal.

How to run the app
Either browse it at:
http://bluebee123.github.io/FEND_P5_Neighborhoodmap/

or:
1) Fork the repository
2) Open either index.html in the main directory or the index.html in the build folder for minified built code.
3) Have fun with the app!

Don't change the folder structure!

---

If you want to check out the grunt setup, run npm install in the main directory in order to install the packages.

Commands:
grunt check: will check the js for errors (prints them in terminal) and beautify the css

grunt build: Will delete the build folder and recopy the files to it, minifying html css and javascript in the process.
